# Gigantum Official Environment Repository

The repository of official Base and Custom environment components available in
the Gigantum app.

These specifications are used by the software in the [gtm
repository](https://github.com/gigantum/gtm) and its submodules. In particular,
the Dockerfiles and related data for actually building the images *described*
here are maintained in the [base-images
submodule](https://github.com/gigantum/base-images) -- an image must be built
and published from there before it can be referenced from this environment
repository.

## Contributing

Gigantum uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). 
This is lightweight approach that doesn't require submission and review of a
separate contributor agreement.  Code is signed directly by the developer using
facilities built into git.

Please see [`docs/contributing.md` in the gtm
repository](https://github.com/gigantum/gtm/tree/integration/docs/contributing.md).
